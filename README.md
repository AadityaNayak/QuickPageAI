### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AadityaNayak/QuickPageAI.git
   cd QuickPageAI
   ```

### Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the QuickPageAI application on your local machine.

1. After downloading the project folder, run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the following command to generate an `AUTH_SECRET`:

   ```bash
   npx auth secret
   ```
   
   This will add `AUTH_SECRET` to your `.env` file, respecting the framework conventions (e.g., Next.jsâ€™ `.env.local`).

3. Set up all the other values in your `.env.local` file. You can find a reference to them in the `.env.example` file in this repo. Here's what you'll need to configure:

   - `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`: [Refer here for API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
   - `AUTH_SECRET`: Automatically created and assigned via `npx auth secret`
   - `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID`: [Refer here for Google OAuth credentials](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)
   - `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET`: [Refer here for Google OAuth credentials](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2)

---

### Run the Application

Once you have configured your `.env.local` file and installed the dependencies, you can run the application locally by executing:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.
